What need to improve 

- we need some clear publish deploy version. (It doesn't work well in the unity website guys.)
- add some effects (sound effects like crashing sounds. and yelling when people get hit.)
- add function (main character get fat when he eats too much vegetables)
- add more enemies. (It's kind of boring when enemies are less.)
- add intereface ui.  (I should make a start scene better)
- add boss?  (enemy boss?)
